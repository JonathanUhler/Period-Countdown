# Period-Countdown
This repositoy is going to be a project that tries to mimic the Chrome Web Store extension periods.io.

The main difference is going to be some slight fixes (especially when it comes to logging in).

This project is also not flexible (not recommended at all) and is designed to be used by the developer.

Maybe in the future, changes will be made to allow users to change the schedule, but periods.io is highly recommended over this.


# Installation
To install the Period Countdown extension, go to chrome://extensions/ and enable "Developer mode"

Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder with the files from this repository. From there, just click on the app to load it

# Configure
In order for the extension to display a countdown timer and being counting down, class names must be added. To do this click on the settings icon in the bottom-left corner. A list of 7 textboxes should appear. Enter the names of the classes you are taking and press the "Save Classes" button.
