# Period-Countdown
This repositoy is going to be a project that tries to mimic the Chrome Web Store extension periods.io.
The main difference is going to be some slight fixes (especially when it comes to logging in).
This project is also not flexible (not recommended at all) and is designed to be used by the developer.
Maybe in the future, changes will be made to allow users to change the schedule, but periods.io is highly recommended over this.
